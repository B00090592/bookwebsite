Defence:
I believe this project is a B grade as the time and effort I put into it ,This website has nearly  completely fulfilled the criteria asked on the requirments form. But a few things are unfinished due to the I had and also the difficulty of the project, Any questions you have on the methods I used in completing this project please ask.
This website is currently live on a free server at www.conorsproject.info , 


First of all the website isnt complete simply because I didn’t have enough time. This website I found was extremlty difficult.
References : if found the use of twig templating really difficult and hard to understand so I used codeigniter framework: https://codeigniter.com/:  I found this easier beacsue there is a lot more information online to shouw you how to setup your website in the best possible way.
As I found twig difficult to understand I have to find a different way of learning:
I found a website call Lynda.com which helped me with my databases and php layouts
https://www.lynda.com/
this gives your good tips in creating your website
I also found these books very easy to understand as I have a hard copy of these books I will reference them.

Templating: 
As to lack of time I had I wasn’t able to personally create a website template as this project is based on being practising your web-development skill, so I Borrowed a basic template to speed up things for myself
https://themeforest.net/
This is where I got the template.
